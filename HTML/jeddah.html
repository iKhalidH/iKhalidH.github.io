        <h1>Jeddah city</h1>
        <p>
            Jeddah (English: /ˈdʒɛdə/ JED-ə), also spelled Jedda, Jiddah or Jidda (/ˈdʒɪdə/ JID-ə; Arabic: جدة‎,
            romanized: Jidda, Hejazi pronunciation: [ˈdʒɪd.da]), is a city in the Hejaz region of Saudi Arabia and the
            country's commercial center. With a population of about 3.5 million people (as of 2020), Jeddah is the
            largest city in Makkah Province, the second-largest in Saudi Arabia (after the capital Riyadh), and the
            tenth-largest in the Arab world. Jeddah Islamic Port, located on the Red Sea, is the second-largest and
            second-busiest seaport in the Arab world (after Dubai's Port of Jebel Ali).
        </p>
        <p>
            Jeddah is the principal gateway to Mecca, the holiest city in Islam, located just 65 kilometres (40 mi) to
            the east, while Medina, the second-holiest city, is located 360 kilometres (220 mi) to the north.
        </p>
        <p>
            Economically, Jeddah is focusing on further developing capital investment in scientific and engineering
            leadership within Saudi Arabia, and the Middle East. Jeddah was independently ranked fourth in the Africa
            – Mid-East region in terms of innovation in 2009 in the Innovation Cities Index.
