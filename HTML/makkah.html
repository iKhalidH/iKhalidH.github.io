        <h1>Makkah city</h1>
        <p>
            Makkah, officially Makkah al-Mukarramah (Arabic: مكة المكرمة‎, romanized: Makkat al-Mukarramah, lit. 'Makkah
            the Noble') and commonly shortened to Mecca,[a] is the holiest city in Islam and the capital of the Makkah
            Province of Saudi Arabia.[2] The city is 70 km (43 mi) inland from Jeddah on the Red Sea, in a narrow valley
            277 m (909 ft) above sea level. Its last recorded population was 1,578,722 in 2015.[3] The estimated metro
            population in 2020 is 2.042 million, making it the third-most populated city in the kingdom. Pilgrims more
            than triple this number every year during the Ḥajj pilgrimage, observed in the twelfth Hijri month of
            Dhūl-Ḥijjah.

            Makkah is the birthplace of Muhammad. The Hira cave atop the Jabal al-Nur ("Mountain of Light") is just
            outside the city and is where Muslims believe the Qur'an was first revealed to Muhammad.[4] Visiting Makkah
            for the Hajj is an obligation upon all able Muslims. The Great Mosque of Makkah, known as the Masjid
            al-Haram, is home to the Ka'bah, believed by Muslims to have been built by Abraham and Ishmael, is one of
            Islam's holiest sites and the direction of prayer for all Muslims (qibla), cementing Makkah's significance
            in Islam.[5]
